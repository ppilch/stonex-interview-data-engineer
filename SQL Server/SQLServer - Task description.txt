Overview:
Attached is customers.csv file containing data about customers with unique CustomerId column.
Requirements are to import data from this file to Interview database.
This should be achieved by using a SSIS package to extract, transform and load the data from the file to a new tables in SQL Server.
Please take a look at SQLServer - Interview DB Setup.sql and SQLServer - OLAP.DimCountry.sql scripts which are prerequisities to start this task - these just need executing to create Interview database and OLAP.DimCountry table required for the task.
The process should be rerunnable - i.e. if a new csv file is provided with the same name, columns and similar data, the import should work. It should also work when the same file is imported multiple times.

Detailed requirements:
A. Extract stage:
A1. Craete a new table: Extract.Customers.
A2. Column names should match column names from the csv file.
A3. Column types should be picked up basing on the data in the file and are up to dev to decide.
A4. Simply extract data from the file and insert to the table without any transformations.

B. Transform stage:
B1. Create a stored procedure to transform the data and move it from ExtractCustomer to Transform.Customers table.
B2. Transform.Customers table should have the following columns:
- Index - mapped from Extract.Customers
- CustomerId - mapped from Extract.Customers
- CustomerName - new column - concatenation of FirstName and LastName with a space in the middle.
- Company - mapped from Extract.Customers
- CountryKey - INT - link OLAP.DimCountry to get this column from there. Join on country name. Return -1 where there is no matching record.
- Phone1 - mapped from Extract.Customers but when the value in the source doesn't start with a digit, + sign or ( sign - set it to 'Unknown'.
- Phone2 - mapped from Extract.Customers but when the value in the source doesn't start with a digit, + sign or ( sign - set it to 'Unknown'.
- Email - mapped from Extract.Customers
- EmailDomain - domain part of the email (everything after @ sign)
- SubscriptionDateKey - INT - Subscription Date in format YYYYMMDD
B3. Skip records where both FirstName and LastName are missing.
B4. In case a varchar value is missing for a column, replace with 'Unknown'. When INT values is missing, replace with -1.

C. Load stage:
C1. Create a new table: OLAP.DimCustomers
C2. Include all columns from the transform table.
C3. Add a new column CustomerKey which will be Primary Key. It should be identity column starting from 1 incrementeing by 1.
C4. Add an extra row with CustomerKey = -1 and 'Unknown' values for VARCHAR and -1 for INT columns
C5. Finally, create a stored procedure to load the data into the final dimension table: OLAP.DimCustomers
C6. Insert a customer if it doesn't exist in the target table yet and update if it exists and some of the values has changed.

D. SSIS Package
D1. Create a SSIS Package which will be responsible for running the extract, transform and load processes in the correct order.
D2. Parameterize connection string to the .csv file and the Interview database.

E. Expected results:
E1. We expect a .dtsx file (SSIS package) to be pushed to github together with any .sql files created: three separate .sql files for each table and three separate .sql files for each notebook + any extra files if more were needed.

Scoring criteria:
We will evaluate the results within the following cirteria:
- Reliability (no bugs, re-runable)
- Requirements (if all requirements are implemented)
- Code quality (formatting, usefull comments, readability of the code)

The reqirements are explained in details and hopefully complete, but in case of any questions which are not covered please use common sense and implement the easiest solution.
Also, in case of any blocker you may encounter try to find a workaround or the best possible solution to solve this task.

Good luck!
